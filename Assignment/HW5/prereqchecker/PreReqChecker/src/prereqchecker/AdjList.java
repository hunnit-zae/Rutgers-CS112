 * 2. a lines, each with 1 course ID
 * 3. b (int): number of edges in the graph
 * 4. b lines, each with a source ID
 * 
 * Step 2:
 * AdjListOutputFile name is passed through the command line as args[1]
 * Output to AdjListOutputFile with the format:
 * 1. c lines, each starting with a different course ID, then 
 *    listing all of that course's prerequisites (space separated)
